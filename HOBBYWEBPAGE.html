    <p> Swimming Australia is the peak governing body for competitive swimming in Australia. The body has approximately 100,000
    registered members nationally in 1100 clubs across the country, which includes swimmers, coaches, officials,
    administrators and volunteers. The body oversees the management and development of the sport from the national team at
    the elite level, the conduct of national and international events, through to grass roots participation.
    
    In 1985, the organisation had approximately 90,000 registered members.[2]

   <b>History </b> 
    Competitive national swimming championships were first held in 1894. Australia had swimmers at most major international
    swimming events since the 1896 Summer Olympics.[3]
    
    <i>This interest led to the creation of the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia, </i> the precursor to Swimming Australia, which
    was founded in 1909 at a meeting of state swimming representatives at the Sports Club on Hunter Street in Sydney's CBD.
    There they established a charter which included the key features of the promotion of uniformity of rules and regulations
    across Australia; the adjudication all matters of disputes between affiliated associations; the control and management
    of swimmers visiting Australia; the control and management of Australian representatives in any contest of international
    nature; and control the recognition of all "best on record" performances.[4]
    
    Within a short time the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia had extended its charter to include negotiation with the
    recently formed International Swimming Federation <mark>Fédération Internationale de Natation, FINA.

    <i>James Taylor was the foundation president and served for the first 35 years of the body's existence from 1909 to 1944. </i>
    
    During 1985, under a new corporate structure, the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia was incorporated in the Australian
    Capital Territory and became Australian Swimming Inc.
    
    <s> On 1 October 2004, </s> Australian Swimming became a company limited by guarantee and changed its name to Swimming Australia
    Ltd.[5] Glenn Tasker served as the chief executive officer until June 2008, and the organisation's headquarters is
    located at Unit 12, 7 Beissel Street, Belconnen, ACT. In 2013, Mark Anderson was appointed CEO.
    
    The Australian Swim Team underwent a rebranding in 2014 and was renamed the Australian Dolphins Swimming Team.
    
    <mark>In 2022, it established the Swimming Australia Hall of Fame.[6]
